Yang's GIS page aims to share research progresses and resources of Geographical Information Science (GIS), UAV & Drone, and spatio-temporal geo-statistics. 

I am an interdisciplinary postdoc in the 
Department of Sociology
and the College of Sciences Geospatial Technologies Cluster at 
the University of Central Florida (UCF), leading a drone mapping team for an NSF colaborative coastal mapping project supports Citizen Science GIS. I have multiple education backgrounds with a B.S. degree in applied mathematics, an M.S. in computer science, and an M.A. in GIS. I received my Ph.D. in geography at the University of 
Cincinnati (UC) in 2018. 

My research interests are: **_GIScience, citizen science, UAV & drone coastal mapping, spatial 
statistics, environmental and sociological modeling._**

I am an FAA part 107 remote pilot and NASBLA recognized boat driver. Besides of doing research and teaching, I like fiddling with tech gadgets, car mod, and playing basketball.
