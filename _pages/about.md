Yang's GIS blog aims to share research progresses and resrouces of Geographical Information Science (GIS), UAV & Drone, machine learning, and spatio-temporal geo-statistics. 

I am an interdisciplinary postdoctoral scientist in the 
[Department of Sociology](https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/) 
and the College of Sciences Geospatial Technologies Cluster at 
the University of Central Florida (UCF). I have an multiple education backgrounds with a B. S. degree in applied mathematics, a M.S. in computer science, and a M.A.  in GIS. I received my Ph.D. in 
the Geography at the [University of 
Cincinnati](
https://www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/geography.html/) in 2018. 

My research interests are: **_GIScience, spatial 
statistics, UAV & drone coastal mapping, machine learning 
algorithms, environmental and sociological modelling._**

I am a FAA part 107 remote pilot and NASBLA recognized boat driver. Besides of doing research and teaching, you can find me fiddling with tech gadgets, car mod, and playing basketball.

## NSF Drone Mapping and GIS for coastal seagrass

I am co-leading with [Dr. Timothy Hawthorne](https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/thawthorne/) a collaborative $1.3 million dollar grant  from National Science Foundation (NSF) [Division of Ocean Sciences](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=oce) supports [Citizen Science GIS](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). [More information](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/projects/drone-mapping/) of the NSF project can be found at Citizen Science GIS website.


## Geo-statistical algorithms

For my doctoral dissertation, I developed and implemented a novel geo-statistical method that used to assimilate multi-scale data sets with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial densities. The algorithm has been made available in Python and ArcGIS packages with a user-friendly interface. High-performance computing on supercomputer and parallel computing are utilized to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.
