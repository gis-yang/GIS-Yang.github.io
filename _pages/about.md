Yang's GIS page aims to share research progresses and resources of Geographical Information Science (GIS), UAV & Drone, and spatio-temporal geo-statistics. 

I am an interdisciplinary postdoc in the 
Department of Sociology
and the College of Sciences Geospatial Technologies Cluster at 
the University of Central Florida (UCF), leading a drone mapping team for an NSF colaborative coastal mapping project supports Citizen Science GIS. I have multiple education backgrounds with a B.S. degree in applied mathematics, an M.S. in computer science, and an M.A. in GIS. I received my Ph.D. in geography at the University of 
Cincinnati (UC) in 2018. 

My research interests are: **_GIScience, citizen science, UAV & drone coastal mapping, spatial 
statistics, environmental and sociological modeling._**

I am an FAA part 107 remote pilot and NASBLA recognized boat driver. Besides of doing research and teaching, I like fiddling with tech gadgets, car mod, and playing basketball.

# Projects

## [NSF Drone Mapping and GIS for coastal seagrass](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/projects/drone-mapping/)
I serve as leading postdoc for a collaborative $1.3 million dollar grant  from National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Ocean Sciences supports Citizen Science GIS at the University of Central Florida (UCF). This project is one of the earliest attempts to employ UAV mapping in seagrass management and conservation across 23 degrees of latitude over an extended time series.

## [Geo-statistical algorithms & ST-Cokriging](https://github.com/gis-yang/Crime-prediction)

For my doctoral dissertation, I developed and implemented a novel geo-statistical method that used to assimilate multi-scale data sets with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial densities. The algorithm has been made available in Python and ArcGIS packages with a user-friendly interface. High-performance computing on supercomputer and parallel computing are utilized to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.

## [Citizen Science GIS](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/)
Citizen Science GIS, a 2017 Esri Special Achievement in GIS Award winner (one of four higher education awardees worldwide), is housed at University of Central Florida lead by Dr. Timothy Hawthorne. We are a diverse group of faculty, students, and community partners around the world committed to strengthening the connections between science and society.

### Geog1021 World Regional Geography
![image](/images/worldgeography.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}
World Regional Geography investigates the variety and difference of places and realms. While maintaining a strong focus on relationships and connections of different parts of the world. This course also introduces the academic discipline of geography with applications of geography by engaging geographic approaches to social issues. Students will leave the course with an appreciation for geographic thinking, and the ability to contextualize global events, such as climate, economic, political, culture and etc. The knowledge is invaluable to understand your place in the world.                                                                                                                          

### Geog1005 Human Geography in Action
![image](/images/humangeography.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}
Human Geography in Action introduces the historical, sociological, economical, and political forces that have shaped society. National and international policies and relationships and their connections to current news and events will be covered. Human geography deals with the world as it is and with the world as it might be made to be. Its emphasis is on people: where they are, what they are like, how they interact over space, and what kinds of landscapes of human use they erect on the natural landscapes they occupy. It encompasses all those interests and topics of geography that are not directly concerned with the physical environment or, like cartography, are technical in orientation.                                                                                                                    

### Geog1012 Landform and soils
![image](/images/landsoil.png){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"} Landform and soils provides a broad introduction to the Earth's landforms, its soils, and the processes that form them. A systems approach is used to link process with landscapes and soils. Included in the course are discussions of tectonic movements such as subduction (crustal destruction) and orogeny (mountain building), mass movements such as landslides and surface creep, the hydrologic cycle and water balances, fluvial (running water) systems and flood behavior, coastal erosion and movement, glacial processes, and soil development and differentiation.
