## [NSF Drone Mapping and GIS for coastal seagrass](https://www.citizensciencegis.org/nsfsmithsoniandrones)
I am co-leading with [Dr. Timothy Hawthorne](https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/person/timothy-hawthorne/) the UAV mapping of coastal seagrass sites along the Pacific (west) coast of North America through a $1.3 million collaborative NSF grant for the UCF portion, one of the earliest attempts to employ UAV mapping in coastal management and seagrass conservation. This interdisciplinary project aims to assess the interactions of three major stressors to coastal ecosystems (climate warming, altered biodiversity, and disease) on the local and regional health of seagrass integrate ecological, microbiological, computational, geospatial analysis, and UAV remote sensing.

For the past two summers, I have been leading a drone mapping team travel along the Pacific coast and collected over 10,000 drone mapping data along the Pacific coast. The drone remote sensing and field sampling sites include (From north to south): (1) six sites around Prince of Wales Island, Alaska; (2) five sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia; (3) five sites in the San Juan Islands; (4) three sites in Yaquina Bay, Oregon; (5) two sites in Coos Bay, Oregon; (6) six sites in Bodega Bay and Tomales Bay, northern California; and (7) six sites in San Diego and Mission Bay in southern California.

## [Geospatial data science & machine learning for Environmental science](https://github.com/gis-yang/Crime-prediction)

For my doctoral dissertation, I developed and implemented a novel geo-statistical method that used to assimilate multi-scale data sets with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial densities. The algorithm has been made available in Python and ArcGIS packages with a user-friendly interface. High-performance computing on supercomputer and parallel computing are utilized to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.

## [K12 outreach, participory GIS research, and Citizen Science](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/new-teacher-funding-for-drones-gis-and-fieldwork-from-our-nsf-grant/?preview_id=4979&preview_nonce=b4d097d0f3&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=4982)
I am co-leading the NSF RET project to build mutually rewarding partnerships with K-12 science teachers to transfer teachersâ€™ experience in cutting edge research to the broader impact content in the classroom. Iwork with teachers participating fieldworks and developing science lessons using fieldwork data and drone mapping principles to support inquiry-based learning with students.

## [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
I am in the developer team of GRASS7 for satellite image segmentation module (i.segment). GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System), is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization.
