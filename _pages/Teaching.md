![image](/images/gisinsociety.png){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}
GIS in Society class is an intro and intermediate course focusing on the conceptual introduction, methodological, and practical applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as the technology's use in society continues to evolve and expand. Students will learn how to use GIS for spatial thinking and spatial analysis. Advanced topics may include, but are not limited to: GIS for exploring social & environmental inequalities, drone and satellite remote sensing, GIS programming for python.The lecture will cover theories, methodologies and applications of GIS techniques. The labs are designed to give students hands-on experience using ArcMap and ArcGIS Online.

### Geog1021 World Regional Geography
![image](/images/worldgeography.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}
World Regional Geography investigates the variety and difference of places and realms. While maintaining a strong focus on relationships and connections of different parts of the world. This course also introduces the academic discipline of geography with applications of geography by engaging geographic approaches to social issues. Students will leave the course with an appreciation for geographic thinking, and the ability to contextualize global events, such as climate, economic, political, culture and etc. The knowledge is invaluable to understand your place in the world.                                                                                                                          

### Geog1005 Human Geography in Action
![image](/images/humangeography.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}
Human Geography in Action introduces the historical, sociological, economical, and political forces that have shaped society. National and international policies and relationships and their connections to current news and events will be covered. Human geography deals with the world as it is and with the world as it might be made to be. Its emphasis is on people: where they are, what they are like, how they interact over space, and what kinds of landscapes of human use they erect on the natural landscapes they occupy. It encompasses all those interests and topics of geography that are not directly concerned with the physical environment or, like cartography, are technical in orientation.                                                                                                                    

### Geog1012 Landform and soils
![image](/images/landsoil.png){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"} Landform and soils provides a broad introduction to the Earth's landforms, its soils, and the processes that form them. A systems approach is used to link process with landscapes and soils. Included in the course are discussions of tectonic movements such as subduction (crustal destruction) and orogeny (mountain building), mass movements such as landslides and surface creep, the hydrologic cycle and water balances, fluvial (running water) systems and flood behavior, coastal erosion and movement, glacial processes, and soil development and differentiation.                                                                                                                                                      


### Geog1040 Earth from Space
![image](/images/Earthfromspace.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}  Earth from Space introduces basic concepts, principles and applications of satellite remote sensing, Global Positioning System (GPS), Web-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for the Earth Observations. The lectures cover the shape, size and motion of the Earth in space, geographical coordinate system, basic principles of satellite remote sensing, satellite orbits and remote sensors, satellite image interpretation and visualization, basic principles of GPS, internet GIS and digital earth, applications of satellite remote sensing in weather forecasting, hurricane tracking, ocean observation, terrestrial topography and geomorphology, vegetation canopy, human settlements, and natural hazard managements.                                                                                                    


### Geog1044 Natural Hazards and Disasters
![image](/images/naturehazard.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"} Natural Hazards and Disasters introduces basic concepts, causes, physical characteristics, spatial patterns, and impacts of natural hazards and disasters. The lectures cover earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, coastal erosions, droughts, floods, and wildfires. Scientific knowledge, planning measures, management policy, and geo-spatial technologies will be also introduced for supporting societal preparedness, response, mitigation, recovery, and management of natural disasters.                                                                                                                                                                                      


### Geog1001 Introduction to Physical Geography
![image](/images/phisicalgeography.jpg){:height="240px" width="240px"}{: style="float: left"}  Introduction to Physical Geography provides a survey of the complete spectrum of physical geography including climate and weather, geomorphology and landscapes, as well as biogeography and the environment. The emphasis is on fundamentals, the human impact on natural systems, and application.
