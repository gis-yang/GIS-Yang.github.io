### Geog1012 Landform and soils
![image](/images/landsoil.png){:height="300px" width="300px"}{: style="float: left"} This course provides a broad introduction to the Earth's landforms, its soils, and the processes that form them. A systems approach is used to link process with landscapes and soils. Included in the course are discussions of tectonic movements such as subduction (crustal destruction) and orogeny (mountain building), mass movements such as landslides and surface creep, the hydrologic cycle and water balances, fluvial (running water) systems and flood behavior, coastal erosion and movement, glacial processes, and soil development and differentiation.

### Geog1040 Earth from Space
![image](/images/Earthfromspace.jpg){:height="300px" width="300px"}{: style="float: left"}  This course introduces basic concepts, principles and applications of satellite remote sensing, Global Positioning System (GPS), Web-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for the Earth Observations. The lectures cover the shape, size and motion of the Earth in space, geographical coordinate system, basic principles of satellite remote sensing, satellite orbits and remote sensors, satellite image interpretation and visualization, basic principles of GPS, internet GIS and digital earth, applications of satellite remote sensing in weather forecasting, hurricane tracking, ocean observation, terrestrial topography and geomorphology, vegetation canopy, human settlements, and natural hazard managements. 


### Geog1044 Natural Hazards and Disasters
![image](/images/naturehazard.jpg){:height="300px" width="300px"}{: style="float: left"} This course introduces basic concepts, causes, physical characteristics, spatial patterns, and impacts of natural hazards and disasters. The lectures cover earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, coastal erosions, droughts, floods, and wildfires. Scientific knowledge, planning measures, management policy, and geo-spatial technologies will be also introduced for supporting societal preparedness, response, mitigation, recovery, and management of natural disasters.

### Geog1001 Introduction to Physical Geography
![image](/images/phisicalgeography.jpg){:height="300px" width="300px"}{: style="float: left"}  This course provides a survey of the complete spectrum of physical geography including climate and weather, geomorphology and landscapes, as well as biogeography and the environment. The emphasis is on fundamentals, the human impact on natural systems, and application.
