## [Open-access drone mapping course](https://gis-yang.github.io/DroneMapping/)
![image](/images/dronetraining.jpg){:height="220px" width="220px"}{: style="float: left"}
This open-access drone mapping training course is designed to use drones to collect remote sensing data for coastal mapping and seagrass conservation. We create this training course for research partners and broader communities to learn how to fly drones, and perform data processing in Geographical Information Science (GIS) method. This training course contains topics of flying drones, coastal mapping principles, safety guides, preflight and planning, FAA part 107 examination, drone image stitching software, geographical fieldwork principles, and GIS based drone image analyses. 



## [Citizen Science GIS](http://www.citizensciencegis.org/)
Citizen Science GIS, a 2017 Esri Special Achievement in GIS Award winner (one of four higher education awardees worldwide), is housed at UCF Department of Sociology and the UCF College of Sciences Geospatial Technologies Cluster lead by [Dr. Timothy Hawthorne]((https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/person/timothy-hawthorne/)). We are a diverse group of faculty, researchers, students, and community partners around the world committed to strengthening the connections between science and society. Checkout our [website](https://www.citizensciencegis.org/) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/citizensciencegis/)/[twitter](https://twitter.com/citizen_gis) for more information and oppotunities. We are hiring Undergraduate Research Assistants and Graduate Research Assistants.

## [Geo-statistical algorithms & ST-Cokriging](https://github.com/gis-yang/Crime-prediction)

For my doctoral dissertation, I developed and implemented a novel geo-statistical method that used to assimilate multi-scale data sets with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial densities. The algorithm has been made available in Python and ArcGIS packages with a user-friendly interface. High-performance computing on supercomputer and parallel computing are utilized to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.
