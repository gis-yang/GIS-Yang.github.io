![image](/images/dronetraining.jpg){:height="220px" width="220px"}{: style="float: left"}
This open-access drone mapping training course is designed to use drones to collect remote sensing data for coastal mapping and seagrass conservation. We create this training course for research partners and broader communities to learn how to fly drones, and perform data processing in Geographical Information Science (GIS) method. This training course contains topics of flying drones, coastal mapping principles, safety guides, preflight and planning, FAA part 107 examination, drone image stitching software, geographical fieldwork principles, and GIS based drone image analyses. 


## [Geo-statistical algorithms & ST-Cokriging](https://github.com/gis-yang/Crime-prediction)

For my doctoral dissertation, I developed and implemented a novel geo-statistical method that used to assimilate multi-scale data sets with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial densities. The algorithm has been made available in Python and ArcGIS packages with a user-friendly interface. High-performance computing on supercomputer and parallel computing are utilized to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.
